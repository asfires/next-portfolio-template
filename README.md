# next-portfolio-template

A modern, minimalist Next.js 13 web dev portfolio template with mobile navigation.

## Usage

```bash

npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/asfires/next-portfolio-template

```

Just edit `siteConfig` in `config\site.ts` and replace the example image URLs, files, projects, links, etc. with your own. `sourceLink` is optional in the event that you have proprietary code that can't be shared.

Images for the root and **About** pages are also mapped from `siteConfig`. The text for these two pages can be modified directly in `app\page.tsx` and `app\about\page.tsx` respectively.

## Features

- Next.js 13 App Directory

- [shadcn-ui components](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

- Tailwind CSS with class-sorting, merging and linting

- Icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev)

- Dark mode with `next-themes`
